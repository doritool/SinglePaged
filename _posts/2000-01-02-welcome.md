# WELCOME TO DORITOOL
The emergence of high-throughput data in biology has increased the need for functional in '_silico_' analysis by developing integrative bioinformatics tools.

DoriTool, is a comprehensive, easy, and friendly pipeline integrating biological data from different functional tools with the aim of maximazing reproducibility, facilitate the obtention of biologically meaningful data and reducing the working time of the researchers, especially those with limited bioinformatic skills.

DoriTool is, the most complete bioinformatic tool offering functional ‘_in silico_’ annotation of variants previously associated with a trait of interest, shedding light on the underlying biology and helping the researchers in the interpretation and discussion of the results at mutation/variant level, Gene level; Pathway level and at Network level, by combining up-to-date functional and genomic data integrating also third-party bioinformatics tools in a pipeline. DoriTool uses _GRCh37_ human assembly and online mode.


DoriTool provides nice visual reports including variant annotation, linkage disequilibrium proxies, gene annotation, gene ontology analysis, _eQTLs_ results from _GTEx_ and coloured pathways.

Here we show also DoriTool functionalities by applying it to a dataset of 23 variants associated with drug addiction.
